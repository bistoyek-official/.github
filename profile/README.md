## About us

**bistoyek (21) Research and Innovation Center**

bistoyek (written in lower case and pronounced “بیست و یک” meaning Twenty-One) is a new tech startup founded by Kasra Fouladi on June 30, 2023. We are a young organization working primarily in the field of computer science with a focus on informatics.

**Our Activities:**

- **Research Projects:**  
  We have completed a cryptography project that looked into new methods for enhancing data security. We are also working on a sizable project in the area of artificial intelligence, which is exploring the use of deep learning and neural networks for decision-making tasks.

- **Academic and Educational Initiatives:**  
  Our aim is not only to develop research projects but also to share our findings with the community. We publish academic articles and plan to launch a scientific-educational journal, *Insight Informatics*. In addition, we develop educational content and programs especially for computer science students and other interested individuals.

- **Collaborative Projects and Commercial Applications:**  
  While most of our work is research-driven, we also welcome contributions from external researchers and tech enthusiasts. Our projects sometimes follow practical applications or theoretical explorations, and we are exploring ways to bring some of our research outputs into commercial use on a modest scale.

As a nascent organization, we value openness, collaboration, and continuous learning. Our mission is to contribute to the field of informatics while growing as a research-driven tech startup.
